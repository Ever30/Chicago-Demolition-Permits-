## Everardo Garcia   

## Notes:

  - The data to perform this project was obtained from the official site of Chicago Data Portal (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Buildings/demolition-permits/e4xk-pud8/about_data)

  - Permits issued by the Department of Buildings in the City of Chicago from 2006 to the present. The dataset for each year contains more than 65,000 records/rows of data and cannot be viewed in full in Microsoft Excel. Therefore, when downloading the file, select CSV from the Export menu. Open the file in an ASCII text editor, such as Wordpad, to view and search. Data fields requiring description are detailed below.
    
  - PERMIT TYPE: "New Construction and Renovation" includes new projects or rehabilitation of existing buildings; "Other Construction" includes items that require plans such as cell towers and cranes; "Easy Permit" includes minor repairs that require no plans; "Wrecking/Demolition" includes private demolition of buildings and other structures; "Electrical Wiring" includes major and minor electrical work both permanent and temporary; "Sign Permit" includes signs, canopies, and awnings both on private property and over the public way; "Porch Permit" includes new porch construction and renovation (defunct permit type porches are now issued under "New Construction and Renovation" directly); "Reinstate Permit" includes original permit reinstatements; "Extension Permits" consists of an extension of the original permit when construction has not started within six months of original permit issuance.
